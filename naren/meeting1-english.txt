If everyone is here, let's get started. First, please join me in welcoming our Southwest Area Sales Vice President.

Thank you all for inviting me. I am looking forward to today’s meeting.

Next, I’d like to introduce a new team member who recently joined us.

I also want to introduce my assistant.

Welcome. Unfortunately, our national sales director can't be with us today; she is currently in Kobe, developing our Far East sales force.

Let’s begin. Today, we are here to discuss ways to improve sales in rural markets. First, let’s review the report from the last meeting held on June 24th. Over to you.

Thank you. The main points of the previous meeting were: we approved the changes in our sales reporting system discussed on May 30th. After briefly reviewing the upcoming changes, we moved on to a brainstorming session about improving after-sales support. A copy of the main ideas discussed is in the photocopies in front of you. The meeting was declared closed at 11:30.

So, if there’s nothing else to discuss, let’s move on to today’s agenda. Has everyone received a copy of the agenda? If you don’t mind, I’d like to skip item 1 and go directly to item 2: Sales improvement in rural markets. Someone has kindly agreed to give us a report on this topic.

Before I start, I’d like to gather some ideas from everyone. How do you feel about rural sales in your districts? Let’s go around and share opinions.

Some mentioned that the focus has been too much on urban customers and their needs. The suggestion was to refocus on rural areas by developing targeted advertising campaigns.

Others disagreed, believing rural customers want to feel just as valued as city customers. They recommended providing rural sales teams with better customer information reports.

Someone asked for a repeat of the point.

It was explained that the same comprehensive customer data provided to city sales staff should also be available to rural sales teams.

A member suggested splitting into groups to discuss the ideas presented.

Due to time constraints, it was agreed to postpone further discussion to a future meeting.

Before closing, the main points were summarized:

Rural customers need special help to feel valued;
Our sales teams need more accurate and detailed customer information;
A survey will be conducted to gather data on spending habits in these areas;
The survey results will be provided to the sales teams;
We are considering advanced data mining techniques to deepen understanding.
Finally, the meeting organizer confirmed that the main agenda items were covered, asked if there was any other business, and discussed scheduling the next meeting. Everyone agreed to meet again on a Friday at 9:00 AM, two weeks from now.

The meeting was then adjourned. Thank you all for participating!
